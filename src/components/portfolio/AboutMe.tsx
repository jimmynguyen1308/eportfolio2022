      <p><b>Welcome to my personal website/blog/ePortoflio!</b></p>
      <p>My name is Nhat, but for those English speakers you can just call me James. I'm from Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ and currently I am living and working in Sydney, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º as a frontend web developer.</p>
      <p>Alongside mastering my designing and web-developing skills, I often write blog posts and articles casually; thus, this site is the place for me to store and show all of my work.</p>
